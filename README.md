# work-day-scheduler-week-5-challenge
This project was really interesting. I started it out by creating a variable for the current date and current day. I then created a variable called start time that contains the hour for when the time blocks will start which I put at 7. I then created a variable to see if it is in the morning which will be used later in the program to create the time ID for the time block. The last variable I created is a task arr that will store all of the tasks. I then append the current day with the current day and date variable I created so the date is at the top. Next I make a function that will take the id of the time block and make a time id for the user to know what the time is for that block. Next I make a function that takes in the time id for the time block and gives it the appropriate class to color the task from the classes of past, present, or future. I then make the functions for the save and load function. The save task will assign each task a date, time and task description. then push it to the task array and store the task array into local storage. The load task pulls in the local storage and if it is not null it will store it in the task array and update the time blocks to the appropriate block. it will also check the date to make sure it is today's date. I then created the function to create each individual task block to store the task. I created a for loop that iterates 11 times. within the loop it makes a time id by adding the start time and the number of that block then it creates that individual row to hold all the divs of that timeblock. I then created a title element to hold the time of that block and add the hour class to tell the user the time of the block using the create time id as mentioned before. The next section I made was the task section of the time block. it gives it the task class and runs it through the audit function to color it appropriately. The last thing added is the button and then it's appended to the page. I then call the call blocks function and then create the buttons click action listener that pulls in the rows time id the time and reverts it back to military time, pulls in the text from the task that's in that row  and then loads it to the page and saves it to the local storage bia the task array and finally adds the appropriate classes to the time block.

## Lessons Learned
one thing this lesson reinforced was using javascript to create repetitive html elements instead of hard coding them into the page. I learned how to use the sibling function in jquery to get the info of a row that's already made and change elements with the sibling function. The lesson really reinforced separating blocks in different functions to simplify code. I learned how to use moments to keep track of dates and time and also the use of third party API's. I got more experience with bootstrap and jquery for better functionality.
